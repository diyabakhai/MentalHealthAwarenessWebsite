            The Inner Hour diverges from traditional "Self Help" by taking a broader approach. Rather than sticking to a
            small set of topics to deal with mental illness & other issues. The platform addresses important steps you
            can take in the coping process & even have effective action plans for recovery.The Inner Hour is a place
            where
            individuals can overcome their day-to-day challenges in a stigma-free environment. While we aspire of a
            progressive society & culture, we intend to impart practices where mental health taboos & issues can be
            discussed openly & managed effectively with emotional and professional assistance.
